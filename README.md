## About Me

* Currently studying **Analysis and Systems Development** (ADS)
* Transitioning into the **programming** career path
* Passionate about understanding how systems work from the ground up — algorithms, data structures, C/C++ fundamentals, and computer architecture
* Interested in open-source projects, artificial intelligence, and simulation systems

## What You Will Find Here

This space contains:

* My study notes and summaries
* Code exercises and LeetCode solutions
* Small projects to reinforce learning
* Documentation for academic and personal projects

It is my evolving notebook — as I learn, this place grows with me.

## Current Focus Areas

* **Programming Logic (C/C++)**
* **Object-Oriented Programming**
* **Algorithms & Data Structures**
* **Operating Systems (Pthreads, multithreading)**
* **Computer Architecture**
* **Aerospace software fundamentals**
* **Artificial Intelligence basics**

## Long-Term Vision

I’m building a strong foundation so I can:

* Develop aviation-focused applications
* Create simulation tools (like airspace optimization or ATC simulators)
* Work with real-world aviation systems in the future
* Produce a robust TCC related to **Air Traffic Control Simulation and Airspace Optimization**
